# BLINDNESS_DETECTION
 In this project, I developed a blindness detection model using machine learning techniques. Used a dataset of healthy and blind eye images, preprocessed it, and trained a convolutional neural network. Achieved high accuracy in identifying blindness, enabling early detection and intervention for improved outcomes.
